# A Defense of A Phantom Menace (and Jar Jar Binks)

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is often put towards the bottom of most Star Wars movie rankings lists.  I find this rating unfair, as it ignores the intended audience of the film. What critics seem to forget is that The Phantom Menace was a movie made for **children**.

As a millineal I was 10 years old when the movie came out, roughly the same age as Anakin was in the film, and watching a child continually show up adults was awesome.

Jar Jar Binks is often cited as one of the worst Star Wars characters of all time.  For children, his goofy antics were a highlight of the film.
