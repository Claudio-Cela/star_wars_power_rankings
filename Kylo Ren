#Kylo Ren Series
My youngest <sub>Who is 8<sub> has become very interested in the Star Wars Saga and is very partial to Kylo Ren and Darth Vader.
After watching this saga I really feel like Disney dropped the ball on all of the opportunity with these characters by following
the same story arch from the original series, thoughts?
